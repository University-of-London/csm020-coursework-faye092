<h3>Submission Deadline: Monday, 1 April 2024 by 13.00 Greenwich Mean Time</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Please Note:</strong>You are permitted to upload your Coursework in the final submission area as many times as you like before the deadline. You will receive a similarity/originality score which represents what the Turnitin system identifies as work similar to another source. The originality score can take over 24 hours to generate, especially at busy times e.g. submission deadline.</li>
<li>If you upload the wrong version of your Coursework, you are able to upload the correct version of your Coursework via the same submission area. You simply need to click on the 'submit paper' button again and submit your new version before the deadline.</li>
<li>In doing so, this will delete the previous version which you submitted and your new updated version will replace it. Therefore, your Turnitin similarity score should not be affected. If there is a change in your Turnitin similarity score, it will be due to any changes you may have made to your Coursework.</li>
<li>Please note, when the due date is reached, the version you have submitted last, will be considered as your final submission and it will be the version that is marked.</li>
<li><strong>Once the due date has passed, it will not be possible for you to upload a different version of your assessment. Therefore, you must ensure you have submitted the correct version of your assessment which you wish to be marked, by the due date.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Coursework is weighted at 75% of final mark for the module.</p>
